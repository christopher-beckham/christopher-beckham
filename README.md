I am currently an ML researcher at AlpacaML.

Previously, I worked on:
- [DiffusionOperators](https://github.com/neuraloperator/DiffusionOperators), code to accompany the paper _Score-based diffusion models in function space_ by Lim et al. (current maintainer)
- [Wekadeeplearning4j](https://github.com/Waikato/wekaDeeplearning4j) (original author, former maintainer)
